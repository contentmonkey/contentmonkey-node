# ContentMonkey
**ContentMonkey** is a _simple_ but _powerful_ ContentManagement- and Blogsystem.
It should be used for many reasons:
* It is nearly stand-alone, it doesn't need a server like _Apache_ or _nginx_.
* It is very lightweight and runs fast.
* The user interface is easy to control.
* Nearly everything can be customized in the settings or easily in the code.
## Installation
You need to have **NodeJS** and **yarn** installed (see [the README](https://github.com/contentmonkey/contentmonkey)).
Then run `yarn install` and `yarn start` to start the server. It runs on a _SQLite_ database by default.
